# ProjectSummaries

**ChatGPT Experiments** 
- **Researching LLM Tool Use With GPT-4**: Using the OpenAI API, explored GPT-4’s zero-shot tool-use ability with a code interpreter and web search API. This improved code quality and allowed GPT-4 to efficiently synthesize information from a variety of sources with no human input. Also created a general, scalable framework for making new tools and introducing them to the model.
- **Alignment vs. Personality**: Explored methods to get ChatGPT to adopt various personalities and how this conflicted with its alignment training when told to simulate rude or toxic personalities. Findings were consistent with Anthropic’s RLHF paper determining helpfulness vs harmlessness [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862). Examined potential abuse cases and ways bad actors could use this to subvert alignment.

**Graduate Capstone Project with TMF Health Quality Institute**
- Modeled weekly Covid cases across 15,000 nursing homes, highlighting those most at risk of an outbreak in a dashboard and explaining what factors made that nursing home high risk. 
- Worked directly with our corporate sponsor, TMF, over a semester to determine the project requirements and suggest potentially desirable features of the final product.

**Yelp Review Generation** 
- Fine-tuned GPT-2 on a dataset of scraped Yelp reviews to allow it to generate text in the style of a Yelp review. Experimented with methods to generate only positive reviews and found best results by passing the generated text through a sentiment classifier and selecting the most positive, which surprisingly worked better than simply fine-tuning on positive reviews.

**Shopee Product Matching** 
- Created a product-matching model that, given an image and brief text description, finds the most similar product in the dataset using text and image embeddings. [Medium article link.](https://medium.com/@jacksonhassell/image-matching-with-shopee-3174a01648fd)

**Unsupervised Spotify Analysis**
- Analyzed the relationship between different genres of music on Spotify by comparing unsupervised clusters to genre labels. Visualized the results by compressing the high-dimensional data into the X-Y plane.

**Public Sentiment Analysis** 
- Scraped several years’ worth of tweets to track public opinion on two cryptocurrencies and their relationship with climate change over time.

**RiverRaid RL**
- Trained a reinforcement learning model with a custom training loop to maximize its score on an Atari game through the gym framework.

**Computer Science Thesis**
- Modeled ratings over time for the live music show Austin City Limits using proprietary data. Extensively cleaned and processed the data so that it could be used by a machine learning algorithm. Produced a report explaining various historical trends in the dataset, and made predictions about trend changes in the future.
